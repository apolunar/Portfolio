            <h4><b>Main Learnings:</b> A lot about dictionaries, and CSV files.</h4>

        <span>Machine learning is a truly novel thing that I want to do more with. One of the few projects I have done (with help) was N.I.M.A (neural image assessment). Nothing ever came of it because the one good source of image data I did find had all of the images in png or jpg format and I had only ever worked with images in CSV format. Now you may think that this is a point of growth for me and you are completely right. Looking back on it I realize I should have taken a different approach rather than sticking with my current knowledge. At that point, I was struggling with putting the program together and put the project aside but eventually, after I had expanded my knowledge of python with other projects, I came back to the project and started coding. </span><br>
        <span>After some research on CSV files, I made a program that takes in a folder of images, takes their pixel values and goes through a for loop putting them into a dictionary. After that, I used the module CSV and yet another for loop to write the dictionary into a CSV file. To put the labels (what the AI is trying to predict) into the CSV file I used the name of the image but the labels could be entered any way using a text file or with user input when the program shows the user an image. That was it, I had every image converted into a CSV file with labels for ML.</span><br>
        <span>Though I could’ve studied machine learning further I did learn a lot more about CSV files and dictionaries because of this project, those were two areas of python I had not explored before. I am planning to go deeper into machine learning soon and I am pumped to learn more about using png, jpg type images with machine learning.</span><br>
