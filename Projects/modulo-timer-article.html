            <span>Creating pieces of code that may help others is one of the best parts of coding. That is exactly why I created the site <a href="/Projects/modulo-tools-article.html">Modulo</a>. However, that is an entirely different article. In this article, I am explaining the challenges of making my first tool for this helpful website; a timer. I know what you're thinking, isn’t there already like a million timers out there? And you are absolutely right, but this project was a good second non-tutorial project for web development. Plus, a lot of the timers that are out there have ads, and I don’t believe in ads. Though they would make me money, they kind of ruin the experience. Also, I think this timer looks a whole lot better than the other timers out there!</span><br>
            <span>But enough of me defending my timer. A lot went into making this timer. The first and easiest part was the input for the timer. A simple click of the timer text and there are three nice auto-deleting text boxes ready for you to enter your time. This was as simple as hiding the timer text, then showing the inputs and an ‘X’ button. The second, and most difficult part, was starting, stopping and resetting the timer based on the user’s input. You may think of a timer as a simple thing to code and I did too. But no, no, no, I was entirely wrong. There was so much that needed to happen for the timer to work. When the user pressed ‘start’ the ‘start’ text needed to be changed to ‘stop’ and the timer needed to start counting down seconds, then check if it was done or if there was a minute to change to seconds, or an hour to change to minutes to change to seconds. </span><br>
            <span>The most difficult part was creating the loop that runs the timer. I was bent on having the loop start when ‘start’ was pressed and terminate when ‘stop’ was pressed but I had a lot of trouble with scope and not being able to stop the timer outside the function it was started in. Eventually, I gave up and had the loop continuously check for the state of a variable that made everything run. It wasn’t very efficient and there are delays between when the button is pressed and the action happens. </span><br>
            <span>There is a lot of improvement that can be made to this project and there always is to any project. I don’t usually like leaving my projects in this prototype state but I was worn out coding the timer and I wanted to switch to something else. But the most important part of this ordeal is that this horribly long project taught me my entire knowledge of Javascript.</span><br>
