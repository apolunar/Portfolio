            <span>Before now I had thought of web development as something exciting to learn and fairly simple that I could learn pretty fast. There is nothing simple about web development. I feel like I have just started, though I’ve been doing web development for many, many weeks. You may ask, MinerCat, web development is a very general term, what part are you talking about. Well at first I was talking about all of it, but as I am learning I realize how much there is to web dev. I really didn’t know what I was getting into. As I am doing research, to learn I am finding out about React, Node JS, JQuery, SQL, PHP, and so much more. SO MUCH MORE. At first, I was overwhelmed but after starting my own project, I got a much deeper understanding. Just coding, not from a tutorial really improves your confidence.</span><br>
            <span>I made a website using HTML, CSS, JS that displays tools that I can share with anyone, or create tools for anyone that they might use on a daily basis. After being overwhelmed by the unbelievable amount of pieces that can go into web dev I was overwhelmed by how versatile it was. I could share my tools with anyone who has an internet-connected device with a relatively modern browser and the best part; I only had to code it once! This site is a collection of tools so I am giving each tool it’s separate project article because each tool takes FOREVER to make and has its own challenges. The tool selector homepage wasn’t actually that hard to make but then again it was because I was basically new to web dev and it took me a while to get the right elements in the right places looking alright.</span><br>
            <span>This project truly taught me the basics of web dev and because of this project, I am no longer entirely overwhelmed, I am only partially overwhelmed by the web.</span><br>
