            My passion has always been tech, I loved doing things like pressing Ctrl-Shift-I and messing with the elements, finding absolutely every shortcut and combing through settings on computers. Also, whenever I had the chance I tried to help pepole with their tech issues.<br><br>
            I have always been the kind of person who loves to mess around with things like EV3s, M-Bots, and Scratch. But I really got into software development in 6th-grade at Maker Club when the 8th-grade Integrated Math teacher who had been a huge mentor to me helped me to code a bit of Python. After a few more Maker Clubs my love for coding python skyrocketed, I used Stack Overflow, Google and Youtube to learn more and more Python and eventually other languages like C# and Javascript. <br><br>
            Some of my other passions include photography, writing, making, and performing music. I have always had an undying passion to take on any challenge no matter how difficult. I also enjoy messing around with electronics having fun with Rasberry Pis, Microbits, and Little Bits.
