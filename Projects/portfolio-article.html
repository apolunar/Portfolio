            <span>I believe that creating a portfolio is a crucial thing in the life of a software developer. It allows others to see a bit of who you are, gives you a chance to fill in that annoying “website” box on coding websites, and most importantly allows you a place to showcase your work. I mostly created the portfolio you are looking through now to showcase my work and reflect on projects after finishing them and showcase those projects to others. </span><br>
            <span>There were many challenges in creating this portfolio especially because I am still relatively new to HTML, CSS, and JS, things like actually designing the website and coding the functionality or the Javascript. For me, when creating anything that others will use the central challenge is to get something that looks great and works. I have always had trouble designing UIs and I am desperately trying to learn because when creating by yourself, there is nobody else to design UIs for your software for you. The other looming challenge was putting together the Javascript. My biggest challenge with that was making the slide show work on all screen sizes. Though I was able to solve this by checking the user’s screen size with JS media queries it doesn’t work exactly the way I want because it takes a second or two to update the slides. The other huge problem I spent way too long on was how to send emails using a free mail server. Later with more knowledge, I will come back to this project and make it operate without using the quick fix mailto link.</span><br>
            <span>Constructing my portfolio was quite important to me and this framework which will definitely change in the future will help me with various things as a developer like getting an app on the apple app store, giving others a place to navigate to and because of this, I am more experienced as a web developer.</span><br>
